### Python program to:
### 1. read a ﬁle.
### 2. add backslash (\) before every double quote in the ﬁle contents.
### 3. write it to another ﬁle in the same folder.
### 4. print the contents of both the ﬁles.


#### For example:

If the ﬁrst ﬁle is 'TestFile1.txt' with text as:
Jack said, "Hello Pune".
The output of the ﬁle 'TestFile2.txt' should be:
Jack said,\"Hello Pune\".
